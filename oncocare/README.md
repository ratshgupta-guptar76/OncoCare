## Why OncoCare?

Cancer as a disease is emotionally overwhelming for patients to cope with and fighting this is not only a physical battle but a mental trial too. Patients go through a lot of distress and in their journey to overcome this pain, 24/7 support cannot be provided by doctors or therapists.. Sometimes you need to shift your focus when you are doing something as strong as this.
Usually when the cancer is detected, the survival chances are very low.
Even if they survive, it is seen that of the handful of survivors 45.8% show a prevalence of anxiety 19.7% show a predominance  of depression and 11.3% show frequency of lack of concentration.

Given the hardships that the patients go through,  we asked ourselves: How can we make their journey more manageable?  
Medically proven, stress and anxiety can weaken the immune system, so reducing emotional distress might improve a patient's ability to cope with treatment and potentially even impact the effectiveness of their treatment.

A study from JAMA Oncology suggests that social support can significantly influence cancer outcomes, but survival rates vary based on the type of cancer, treatment options, and individual patient circumstances. However, emotional support can certainly bring  a profound impact in their path to recovery eventually helping them improve both their quality of life and possibly their survival rates.
 
According to studies, enhanced  health care  before and during the  treatment has been linked to higher cancer survival.
